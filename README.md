# Hello-world

Hello everyone,

I am guy from Czechia and interested in AWS and cloud computing as a tool for bioinformatics. I studied but did not finished my MSc. in Physical chemistry and computational chemistry. I am trying to get back to the field, but it is hard job to do .. 

Love music, playing piano and guitar .. 
That all for now, folks!
